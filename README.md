# About ```shared-repository```

This repository is a location for communal GeoBlacklight metadata records. This repository is intended to be a place where anyone can contribute metadata records, tools, documentation, and resources that are not inherently tied to a local institution's collection and ingest workflow.


### Community Records for Licensed Products

Many academic institutions subscribe to data providers and extraction interfaces that allow users to locate original datasets (including geospatial data) create maps, and download data for use in external environments. Examples include:

* PolicyMap
* Social Explorer
* Data-Planet
* Simply Analytics

## Submitting records for licensed products

`OpenGeoMetadata` welcomes the submission of records that are applicable to the entire community. Those who submit records are encouraged to create .JSON records that can be adopted for use by multiple institutions. Best practices include the following:

* Add a `ReadMe.md` file or a `.txt` file that explains the origin of the metadata
* Include instructions for local institutions to augment records to reflect availability locally (e.g., how to insert institution-specific proxy server, how to add in a download link, etc).
* Develop records that adhere to the GeoBlacklight Schema as closely as possible.
